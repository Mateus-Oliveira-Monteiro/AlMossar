## Project Description 

<p align="justify">
  
This project was carried out for a college project, the objective was to make a functional interface in C# with integration with a database, the theme was free so we decided to make a fictitious restaurant, in which the objective was to reserve tables for customers  <br>
</p>

## Funcionalities

:heavy_check_mark: Have a login page for the user 

:heavy_check_mark: Reserve tables  

:heavy_check_mark: see, alter and filter existing tables 

:heavy_check_mark: link it all with a database

## How it works
 <p>
After passing the login screen, you can reserve a table, entering the customer's name, surname, number of people and the type of table (a combobox with several predefined types to avoid repetition), after reserving the table you can look at a list of reserved tables and filter by name, you can also change and delete a table reservation <br>
